_This document provides guidance for you to summarize your OLS journey so far and the project you worked on during the entire period of your cohort in a speedblog.  Please draft with your mentor, and share with the OLS team._

----

- Ideally your speed blog will be a written piece with a picture (max 2) and contain some links and references. In terms of word count you are aiming for between 500 and 1200 words.
- We will post your speedblog on OLS website: openlifesci.org/posts
- See this post for guidance on speed blogging: https://software.ac.uk/speed-blogging-and-tips-writing-speed-blog-post
- Example you can draw from: https://openlifesci.org/posts/2019/10/21/culture-track 

**Here are a few questions to help you generate ideas and content for your speedblog:**

## Project background
_Tell us what motivated you to work on this project
Post natal growth failure (PGF) is a complication of prematurity which is a public health problem given its magnitude (1 CHILD/10) and its strong association with infant mortality (28% of deaths).
In our  context there is a Lack of suitable local reference curves and lack of consensus on the use of existing curves (european) for diagnostic.
Few published studies on factors associated with growth failure and its prevention

## Expectations from this program  
_What did you expect or hope to learn from participating in OLS?_
En participant  à ce programme  je souhaitait comprendre le concept de science ouvertert les different aspect et les applications dans la  rechern et dans la vie courante.
## Goals set at the beginning of the project
_Missions and goals set in the beginning of your project in OLS_
•	Décrire la variabilité des paramètres de croissance obtenus après l’utilisation des différentes courbes de croissance (Intergrowth -21, Fenton et OMS) chez les prématurés de petit poids de naissance à Yaoundé au Cameroun.
•	Identifier le profil des parents ainsi que celui des nouveau-nés prématurés de PPN.
•	Déterminer les facteurs associés à la prématurité et montrer leurs influences dans la survenue du retard de croissance extra-utérin.
•	Modéliser les courbes de croissance selon notre contexte.

## Key understanding and accomplishments
_List 2-3 things you've learned or accomplished whilst participating._
At the outset we had several objectives but after following the treaning of open science  and have carried out activities or exchanges with my mentor,we finally opted for this final objectiet
Curent objective : « Make preterm growth data widely understandable in order to propose solutions for the diagnosis and prevention of growth failure  through collaboration. so that no premature child born in Cameroon can  develops growth failure and its many consequences.

## The main goals achieved in this project 
_We were unable to achieve this objective, especially as regards the diagnostic and prediction tool, because the data (especially premature growth parameters) were not available in time,
Nevertheless, we were able to identify a number of factors from which we have proposed actions to be implemented and monitored at the level of primary health care posts and/or at home in families to prevent growth failure in low-resource contexts.

### The initial steps 
_Starting out - what did you do to explore the problems / project?_
au debut nous avons été initié à l'outil Github pour le travail en collabora, bien que we haven't yet had a chance to exploit all its features 
nous avons mieux exploré le problème à travers  l'outil open canva,How to set up a community through a vision, a read me file, missions, personas, pathways,, a code of conduct, and a contributor guideline

### What elements helped you get there? 
_Discussions, connections made, activities carried out, mentors consulted, other?_
nous sommes parvenus à nous en sortir grace aux discutions et activités avec mos mentors, aisi que l'intervention des experts.
## Next steps

### My immediate next step is to...
_Whether you're launching something, bringing someone new in, adding governance, or writing up a project plan or case study - what's happening next?_
After analyzing the data, we intend to develop an appropriate curve for the evaluation of premature newborns in our city 
Create an application open to all for predicting the growth of premature babies in Cameroon.

### Longer term tasks
_What will be the long term goals and sustainability plans - this can also be about starting your project if you did not do that already_extend the study to other neonatology units in other regions of the country in order to achieve a national curve.
Create an association (ASPV prema) to help families of premature newborns, with an online website for the association and our community.
### Staying connected
_Do you plan to stay in touch with the OLS community or other members? If yes, how do you think you can do that?_
Je pense rester en contact avec la communauté en étant mentor pour les prochaines cohortes , si possible francophone, et  je souhaite également soumettre un nouveau projet concernant la creation de l'association d'aide aux familles des enfants prématurés, lors de la prochaine cohorte OLS8.
## Special mentions and acknowledgements
_Please mention ideas, lessons and people who helped you achieve whatever you could in this project so far_
Je tiens à remecier particulièrement mon mentor  Elisée JAFSIA, ainsi que toutes l'équipe du programme OLS qui nous ont accompagné durant ce processuss. JE remercie également le présentateurs des different sujets de Open science qui nous ont beaucoup édifié. un merci égaleement au  personnel de santé et tout les participants à mon sujet de recherche.
